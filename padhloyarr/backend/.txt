✅ 1. Folder Responsibilities
📁 controllers/
Purpose: Handle request logic and business rules.

Files:

authController.js: Contains register, login, and logout functions.

updateUser.js: Handles updating user profile information.

✅ Suggestion: You can move updateUser.js inside a subfolder like controllers/userController.js OR just merge it into a single userController.js.

📁 models/
Purpose: Defines MongoDB schemas and data models.

Files:

User.js: Defines the user schema, password hashing, and password comparison.

✅ Looks good! Nothing to remove here.

📁 middlewares/
Purpose: Reusable middleware functions for route protection.

Files:

authenticateUser.js: Verifies JWT and attaches user to request.

isAdmin.js: Restricts access to admin users only.

✅ Suggestion:

isAdmin.js is not used yet in your routes. If you're not using admin roles right now, you can remove or comment this file temporarily.

📁 routes/
Purpose: Defines API endpoints and maps them to controller functions.

Files:

authRoutes.js: Routes for signup (/signup) and login (/login).

userRoutes.js: Route to update user (PATCH /) — currently very minimal.
